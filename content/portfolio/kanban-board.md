## Intro
I had just landed a new job as a Front-end developer working on a Product management software tool and wanted to immerse myself into the Product management world. Furthermore, I've been interested in building a desktop application using Electron - so this was the perfect opportunity. I also had the chance to exercise my design and UX skills - ensuring the smoothest experience possible for my users. After some trial and error, I built the Electron app as a signed appX file and published it to the Microsoft store.

## Main Features:

- Create unlimited and fully customizable Kanban boards.
- Create and order columns to fit your project's needs.
- Create unlimited custom labels from a varied colour palette.
- Cards can be added to columns and then moved (drag and drop) as they progress.
- Cards can be as detailed as you wish, with a title, description, labels, resource links and To-Do lists.

## Additional Features:

- Select from five unique themes.
- Modern and intuitive user interface.
- No Sign-up, no Wi-Fi, and no ads.
- Regular updates with new features.
