This was accomplished by providing Holiday Park Owners\r\nwith the ability to annotate their Holiday Park maps. Each with its own unique\r\nconfiguration, the annotations mark anything from park facilities to camping\r\npitches. Holiday Parks that use the Pitched Booking system can integrate it into their\r\nInteractive Map, linking the system's units with their map annotations. Holiday\r\nSearchers could then view the Map, click on individual annotations to view more\r\ninformation, and search for availability to get a visual representation of which holiday\r\npitches or caravans are available on their desired arrival date. For instance, those\r\ninterested in fishing might want to reserve a caravan near the fishing lake.","The Interactive Holiday Park Map can be broken down into a collection of deliverables,\r\neach with its own set of tasks and priorities. These deliverables were reached\r\nbefore the application was published. Each project has both end-to-end and unit tests.","The first application, referred to as the Back Office, will be for Holiday Park owners to\r\ncreate and annotate their interactive maps. It will be set out like an admin dashboard\r\nand require the user to log in to access it. This application was built using\r\nVue and BootstrapVue, along with Pixi.js to render the map.","The second application, referred to as the Embedded Map, will present the interactive\r\nMap to Holiday searchers. The application can be linked directly or embedded onto\r\nHoliday Parks' websites and works equally well on desktop and mobile devices.\r\nThis application was built using Vue, along with Pixi.js to render the map.","The REST API, which drives both web applications and follow standard REST\r\nprotocol. Some routes are protected using a JWT authentication mechanism. The\r\nREST API provides developers with a page of auto-generated documentation.\r\nThe REST API was built using Node, Express, TSOA and Mongoose with a MongoDB.","Full Stack Project","MongoDB","Express","WebGL","magic-popups","Magic Popups is a WordPress plugin which allows you to easily add lightweight and customizable popups to your WordPress site.

We were also\r\nencouraged to write both unit and end-to-end tests. My idea\r\nwas to create an online multiplayer shooter.","During gameplay, the server and client interacts through web sockets. It was very important to handle all game logic on the server to prevent the user from cheating by manipulating the JavaScript variables. The 'game loop' which runs on the server at 30 frames per second, emits a ‘tick’ event to the client after each frame which sends with it the data needed to render the game world on the client’s computer screen. The client sends key down, key up and click events to the server through its web socket, the server then processes this information and returns the new model.","This application was built using Vue, along with Pixi.js to render the game on a WebGL context.","The server was built using Node, Express, TSOA, Mongoose with MongoDB and socket.io.\r\nThere are some API endpoints to handle user information, but most of the work\r\nis done with WebSockets."))
