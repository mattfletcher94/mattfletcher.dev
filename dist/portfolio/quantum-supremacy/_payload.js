He addressed several issues associated with\nconventional computer simulations of physics, most notably quantum physics and the need\nto improve methods for representing large amounts of electrons in different states. Feynman\nargued that although simulating physics on a traditional machine is theoretically possible, it is\nimpractical due to the computing cost rising exponentially as the simulation grows in size\n(Feynman, 1982). Therefore, Feynman proposed that to replicate real-world physics, we would\nneed to design a machine “of a different kind”, a quantum programmable machine that could\nimitate the laws of quantum mechanics, namely a quantum computer."}]},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"The term quantum supremacy was born out of Feynman’s ideas. The Google A.I. team states\nthat the realisation of quantum supremacy is when a quantum computer provides a dramatic\nincrease in speed compared to all known classical algorithms (Arute et al., 2019). However, IBM\nstates that quantum supremacy is achieved when a quantum computer has solved a problem\nthat classical computers cannot solve (Palan et al., 2019). Thus, Google A.I. asserts that\nquantum supremacy is defined by benchmarking against conventional computers. In contrast,\nIBM asserts that it occurs when a quantum computer can perform tasks that a conventional\ncomputer cannot. IBM’s definition seems to correlate better with Feynman’s original proposal\nthat a quantum programmable machine would be required to simulate the quantum world.\nFor this paper, it is assumed that quantum supremacy is achieved when quantum computers\nprogress past intriguing scientific endeavours and begin performing tasks that classical\ncomputers are incapable of performing or are incapable of performing quickly enough for\npractical applications."}]},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"This paper will begin by providing context for some of the concepts underlying quantum\ncomputing and how it operates.
