I decided to write\nabout Quantum Computing since this topic interests me.\nAlthough report writing is not my favourite task,\nthis is my best-written work and received a strong First.","The concept of a quantum computer evolved out of the issues raised by Richard Feynman in\n1982 in his paper entitled Computer Simulations of Physics, which ponders the question “Can\nwe simulate physics on a computer?”. He addressed several issues associated with\nconventional computer simulations of physics, most notably quantum physics and the need\nto improve methods for representing large amounts of electrons in different states. Feynman\nargued that although simulating physics on a traditional machine is theoretically possible, it is\nimpractical due to the computing cost rising exponentially as the simulation grows in size\n(Feynman, 1982). Therefore, Feynman proposed that to replicate real-world physics, we would\nneed to design a machine “of a different kind”, a quantum programmable machine that could\nimitate the laws of quantum mechanics, namely a quantum computer.","The term quantum supremacy was born out of Feynman’s ideas. The Google A.I. team states\nthat the realisation of quantum supremacy is when a quantum computer provides a dramatic\nincrease in speed compared to all known classical algorithms (Arute et al., 2019). However, IBM\nstates that quantum supremacy is achieved when a quantum computer has solved a problem\nthat classical computers cannot solve (Palan et al., 2019). Thus, Google A.I. asserts that\nquantum supremacy is defined by benchmarking against conventional computers. In contrast,\nIBM asserts that it occurs when a quantum computer can perform tasks that a conventional\ncomputer cannot. IBM’s definition seems to correlate better with Feynman’s original proposal\nthat a quantum programmable machine would be required to simulate the quantum world.\nFor this paper, it is assumed that quantum supremacy is achieved when quantum computers\nprogress past intriguing scientific endeavours and begin performing tasks that classical\ncomputers are incapable of performing or are incapable of performing quickly enough for\npractical applications.","This paper will begin by providing context for some of the concepts underlying quantum\ncomputing and how it operates. Following that, a debate will occur about what the team\nheaded by the Google A.I. has achieved and whether or not their claim of reaching quantum\nsupremacy with their Sycamore processor is valid since they received a large amount of\ncriticism from IBM. The paper will provide a section discussing the prospects of quantum\ncomputing, whether it will eventually replace classical computers or supplement them ","span","...","portfolio","online-multiplayer-shooter","This project was created for the full-stack module at Plymouth University and received\na strong first.","https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmattfletcher94\u002Fmultiplayer-shooter","See GitHub Repo","https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FhVRlS9BiE78?t=83","See Demo Here","For this module, we had to create a full-stack application and demonstrate\nour ability to handle real-time data using WebSockets. We were also\nencouraged to write both unit and end-to-end tests. My idea\nwas to create an online multiplayer shooter.","During gameplay, the server and client interacts through web sockets. It was very important to handle all game logic on the server to prevent the user from cheating by manipulating the JavaScript variables. The 'game loop' which runs on the server at 30 frames per second, emits a ‘tick’ event to the client after each frame which sends with it the data needed to render the game world on the client’s computer screen. The client sends key down, key up and click events to the server through its web socket, the server then processes this information and returns the new model.","This application was built using Vue, along with Pixi.js to render the game on a WebGL context.","The server was built using Node, Express, TSOA, Mongoose with MongoDB and socket.io.\nThere are some API endpoints to handle user information, but most of the work\nis done with WebSockets.","wordpress-websites","I have designed and developed several WordPress websites outside of work hours.
