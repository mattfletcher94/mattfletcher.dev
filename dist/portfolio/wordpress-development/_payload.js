Feynman\nargued that although simulating physics on a traditional machine is theoretically possible, it is\nimpractical due to the computing cost rising exponentially as the simulation grows in size\n(Feynman, 1982).

Thus, Google A.I. asserts that\nquantum supremacy is defined by benchmarking against conventional computers. In contrast,\nIBM asserts that it occurs when a quantum computer can perform tasks that a conventional\ncomputer cannot. IBM’s definition seems to correlate better with Feynman’s original proposal\nthat a quantum programmable machine would be required to simulate the quantum world.\nFor this paper, it is assumed that quantum supremacy is achieved when quantum computers\nprogress past intriguing scientific endeavours and begin performing tasks that classical\ncomputers are incapable of performing or are incapable of performing quickly enough for\npractical applications."}]},{type:a,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"This paper will begin by providing context for some of the concepts underlying quantum\ncomputing and how it operates.
